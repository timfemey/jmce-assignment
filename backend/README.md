# University Course Aggregator API

This is the backend server for the University Course Aggregator MiniPortal. It's a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript. It provides endpoints to fetch, create, and manage university course data, complete with search, filtering, and pagination capabilities.
---

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Clean, predictable, and resource-oriented endpoints.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and improves code quality and maintainability.
- **Search & Filter**: Dynamically search courses by title and filter by university.
- **Pagination**: Efficiently loads data in pages to handle large datasets.
- **CRUD Operations**: Full support for Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting (CRUD) courses for administrative purposes.
- **Mock Data**: Utilizes an in-memory JSON array, making it easy to set up and test without a database.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **CORS**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher is recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/timfemey/jmce-assignment.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd jmce-assignment/backend
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Build the development backend:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

5.  **Run the server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.
